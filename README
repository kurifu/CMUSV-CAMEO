DISCLAIMER: First and foremost this is a research project under heavy construction. This is in no way indicative of the contributors' coding standards or style, and is NOT indicative of the quality of the final finished product, nor is there any guarantee there will be one.

There is no guarantee that the provided code will compile, but if you are interested in doing so you'll want to buy a couple headsets and start with these:
